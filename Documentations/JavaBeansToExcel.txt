2.Java Beans To Excel:
-Converts Java Beans to Excel files (xlxs) via Apache POI including cellformats.
-BeanColumn:This class represents a column in the Excel sheet. It defines properties.
-FormatType:represents different data formats that a column in the Excel sheet.
-bean2xlsx(List<?> data, BeanColumn[] columns, String filename, String sheetname): 
Converts the list of beans to an Excel file.
It calls addSheet() to add data to the workbook, then writes the workbook to the specified file.
-We Run Junit test cases for this project are:
   which is responsible for exporting data to an Excel file.
   exportDataToXlxs() Test Case:verify whether the Bean2xlsx class correctly exports data to 
   an Excel file when provided with a small amount of test data.
   createBigXLSx() Test Case:  This test case verifies the behavior of the Bean2xlsx class
   when dealing with a large amount of data.
   
   I write my own test cases are:
   exportEmptyDataToXlsx() and it checks the behavior of the Bean2xlsx class 
   when provided with an empty data list.
